# Universal Public Voting (UPV)
## 1. Introduction
The best way to organize humanity is each individual living the Gospel of Jesus Christ as put forth in the Holy Scriptures(The Book of Mormon, New Testament, Old Testament, and possibly others) and obeying the Savior's personal rule after his second coming.  

Until then, I propose a cost-effective yet overriding patch-update to our existing social economic system to improve its reward/cost ratio.  

## 2. Universal Basic Income (UBI) System 

UBI frees people to invest their effort for more effective laborings in the future.  
Suppose the total population is A  

### Costs of UBI
* Difficult to adjust for minimum income levels across regions  
* Cumbersome to adjust for inflation  

Puts an unwilling load on the richer players. The whole point of becoming rich in the current system to be relatively better off than others.

## 3. Universal Public Voting (UPV) System
UPV shares the same 

### Rule 1: Each human ID (H-ID) has a percentage authenticity score which indicates how likely this ID uniquely represents a human.
As with an UBI, people in an UPV would also tend to gain advantage over others via fradulent accounts. Algorithms, multi-level authentication and government IDs should greatly weed out such effects. A percentage score coupled with rule 3 incentivizes individuals to validate their IDs, strengthening this identity system in return.

### Rule 2: Every day, all human IDs freely receive the same amount of single-use voting points for upvoting/downvoting other human ID(s).  
This is a voting system. As such, we can't reuse points as we do with money of other players. This is because the ownership of money is transferrable; whereas the ownership of vote is not. 
There was a Blackmirror episode mocking a UPV. The UPV assumed in that episode grants infinite voting points, which voids the value of votes in the first place. It is not analogous to a system with finite resources such as this one. Begging for votes may still exists as begging for money. But the sender may now be better exused. This peer-pressure is further nullified in rule 4.

### Rule 3: All An ID's percentage The network multiplies this score to all points associated with its ID. 


### Rule 4: A H-ID can void his cast votes.
The original owner can void the face value of all his cast votes, but he can not erase his actions.


### Rule 5: The sender can split his original, single-use points but he must pay the network to send his votes.
Spliting a voting point allows the sender to reward more parties. However it becomes ineconomical when points are split too small. 


### Rule 6: Organization IDs (O-ID) can and only can exist to represent a group of IDs.
An O-ID neither generates nor retains voting points themselves, but it can send points on behalf of a collection of H-IDs or route points to them as according to contracts. Rule 4 can not be violated.

### Rule 7: IDs can be frozen (in the case of a deceased person for example)
In such case, this ID no longer generates voting-points. But it may still receive and retain new incoming voting-points.
