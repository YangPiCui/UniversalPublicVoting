# Universal Public Voting (UPV)

## 1. Introduction
The best way to organize humanity is each individual living the Gospel of Jesus Christ as put forth in the Holy Scriptures(The Book of Mormon, New Testament, Old Testament, and possibly others) and obeying the Savior's personal rule after his second coming.  

Until then, I propose a cost-effective yet overriding patch-update to our existing social economic system.  

Money is a form of voting. Initially, those who vote with money correctly receives more of it to excercise more power in order to benefit the whole. After a certain threshold however, the unsuccessful can never catch up with the successful. This is due to positive reinforcements in the system, such as interest rate. The initial incentive of benefiting the whole will be replaced by the selfish desire of staying on top. This neither helps the rich nor the poor. 

## 2. Universal Basic Income (UBI) System 
UBI frees people to invest their effort for more effective labors in the future. 

### Problem 1: Resistance from the richer players.
An UBI effectively takes money from the rich and gives it to the poor. But the whole point of becoming rich in the monetary system to stay relatively better off than others. 

### Problem 2: Difficult to adjust for minimum income levels across different regions 
The standard of living varies across regions. In addition, systems of government differ. It is very difficult to standardize a common UBI for every country.
 
### Problem 3: Cumbersome to adjust for inflation  
For an UBI to be effective, it must be adjusted to inflation. Not to mention UBI also adds to inflation. Coupled with Problem 2, an effective UBI is very difficult to implement. 
 

## 3. Universal Public Voting (UPV) System
UPV does not give people money, instead, it ensures that everyone always have the same amount of basic voting power.  
  
### Rule 1: Each Human-ID (H-ID) has an authenticity score (ranging from 0% to 100%) which indicates how likely this ID uniquely represents a human.
As with an UBI, people in an UPV would want to gain advantage over others via fradulent accounts. Algorithms, penalties, multi-level authentication and government IDs should greatly weed out such efforts. A percentage score coupled with rule 3 incentivizes individuals to validate their IDs, strengthening this identity system in return.

### Rule 2: Every day, all H-IDs freely receive the same amount of single-use points for upvoting other H-ID(s) only.  
This is a voting system. As such, we can't reuse points as we do with money of other players. This is because the ownership of money is transferrable; whereas the ownership of vote is not. 
There was a Blackmirror episode mocking a UPV. The UPV assumed in that episode grants infinite voting points, which voids the value of votes in the first place. It is not analogous to a system with finite resources such as this one. Begging for votes may still exist just as begging for money does. But rule 4 further aleviates this type of peer-pressure.

### Rule 3: The network multiplies a H-ID's authenticity score to all of its associated points. 
Suppose H-ID A has an authenticity score of 80%; H-ID B 60%; A received 10 points from B. The total value of A's received points from B is calculated as 10 * 80% * 60% = 4.8.

### Rule 4: A H-ID can void his cast votes.
The original owner can void the face value of all his cast votes, but he can not erase his voting history. 

### Rule 5: A H-ID can split his original, single-use points but it must pay the network for sending its votes.
Spliting a voting point allows the sender to reward more parties. However, spamming must be discouraged. 

### Rule 6: Organization ID (O-ID) exists to represent a group of H-IDs.
An O-ID neither generates nor retains voting points themselves, but it can send points on behalf of a collection of H-IDs or route points to them as according to contracts. However, rule 4 shall never be violated.

### Rule 7: IDs can be frozen (in the case of a deceased person for example)
In such case, this ID no longer generates voting-points. But it may still receive and retain new incoming voting-points.


## 4. Discussion
Public Voting System alreayd exists. Think Youtube, Facebook, etc. The goal is to unify them all.
