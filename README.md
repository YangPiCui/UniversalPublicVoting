# UniversalPublicVoting
## Introduction
The best way to organize humanity is each individual living the Gospel of Jesus Christ as put forth in the Holy Scriptures(The Book of Mormon, New Testament, Old Testament, and possibly others) and obeying the Savior's personal rule after his second coming.  
Until then, I propose a cost-effective, small, yet overriding patch-update to our existing social economic system.  

## Problems With any Universal Basic Income System
* Difficult to adjust for minimum income levels across different regions  
* Cumbersome to adjust for inflation  

## An Universal Public Voting System
1. Every human freely receives a single-use point every day to send to other human(s).  
  ** This is a voting system. As such, we can't respend points as we do with money from other players. 
  * This is because the ownership of money is transferrable; whereas the ownership of votes rests with the original voter.


The sender is able to split his unsent points and void his sent ones. 
Each ID has a percentage score which tells how likely the ID uniquely represents a  human.


The network multiplies this score to all points associated with its ID. 
Deceased IDs are frozen but they can still receive points from other IDs. 
Account represents a group of IDs, and it routes points only.
