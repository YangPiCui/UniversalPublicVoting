# Universal Public Voting (UPV)
## 1. Introduction
The best way to organize humanity is each individual living the Gospel of Jesus Christ as put forth in the Holy Scriptures(The Book of Mormon, New Testament, Old Testament, and possibly others) and obeying the Savior's personal rule after his second coming.  

Until then, I propose a cost-effective yet overriding patch-update to our existing social economic system to improve its reward/cost ratio.  

## 2. Universal Basic Income (UBI) System 

UBI rids inefficient labor. It frees people to invest time for more effective labors.

### Costs of UBI
* Difficult to adjust for minimum income levels across regions  
* Cumbersome to adjust for inflation  

Puts an unwilling load on the richer players. The whole point of becoming rich in the current system to be relatively better off than others.

## 3. Universal Public Voting (UPV) System
UPV shares the same 


#### Rule 1: Each human freely receives a single-use point every day to send to other human(s).  
This is a voting system. As such, we can't reuse points as we do with money of other players. This is because the ownership of money is transferrable; whereas the ownership of vote is not. One may argue that 


The sender is able to split his unsent points and void his sent ones. 
Each ID has a percentage score which tells how likely the ID uniquely represents a  human.


The network multiplies this score to all points associated with its ID. 
Deceased IDs are frozen but they can still receive points from other IDs. 
Account represents a group of IDs, and it routes points only.
